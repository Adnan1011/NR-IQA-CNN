# A No Reference Image Quality Assessment System

This project implements a no-reference image quality assessment convolutional neural network (CNN) using the deep learning framework Caffe.
It essentially implements the paper cited in the citations section below.
"Training data preparation scripts" directory contains MATLAB scripts for data pre-processing and preparation.
compute_LCC_SROCC.m is a MATLAB script which computes the linear and Pearson correlation coefiicients of the final results.
train_IQA_CNN_gpu_x.sh scripts train the network using the GPU id x on mulit-GPU machines. When running on a machine with only single GPU use train_IQA_CNN_gpu_0.sh script in the project root directory like this:
./train_IQA_CNN_gpu_0.sh 1 10 fastfading
This will train 10 networks using different combinations of training and validation data subsets on fastfading distortion type. To train the network on all distortions combined use "all" (without quotes) as the third argument to the script


## Dataset used
The network is trained and tested using LIVE database. Using all five distortion types in the database
